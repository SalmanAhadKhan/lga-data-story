  <p>
    Earlier this year in July, the Federal Aviation Administration approved the construction of an AirTrain that would take passengers from LaGuardia Airport to Manhattan. It was a project first initiated by former Governor Andrew Cuomo and approved by the state legislature in 2018. If constructed, the AirTrain would pick up and drop passengers at the Willets Point station where passengers would then be able to connect to the 7 train headed for Manhattan. Critics call it a Cuomo vanity project and a train headed in the wrong direction, since it takes a detour away from Manhattan before passengers can transfer.

  According to ‘A Better Way to LGA,’ a coalition of several local groups, critics are misrepresenting the project by saying the funding should be used for other local needs, such as helping victims of Hurricane Ida,  since the funds can only be for transportation related projects. They also argue that it would clear a lot of congestion around the area by removing over 10 million passengers from the roads and is also the only alternative studied that could be built without disrupting residential or commercial neighborhoods.
