  </body>
  <p>
    Earlier this year in July, the Federal Aviation Administration approved the construction of an AirTrain that would take passengers from LaGuardia Airport to Manhattan. It was a project first initiated by former Governor Andrew Cuomo and approved by the state legislature in 2018, but Governor Hochul paused the project in October this year. Critics call it a Cuomo vanity project and a waste of money because of how few people would actually benefit from the $2.1 billion project. They say the money is better spent helping Queens residents recover from disasters like Hurricane Ida instead.

  According to ‘A Better Way to LGA,’ a coalition of several local groups, critics misrepresent the project by saying funding should be used for other local needs, since the funds can only be for transportation-related projects. They also argue that it is the only alternative that could be built without disrupting residential or commercial neighborhoods.
